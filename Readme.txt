Webtech Node js Project:

This is a group project by Alexander Berger, Maximilian Knapp, Christian Hummel and Lisa-Maria Hollaus
A crud webpage with 5 different views:

Home:

Here you can see our pictures and ids, on the top left is our navbar with links to the Users page and the create a new user page
on the bottom there are two buttons, if you click on them, you will also be redirected to the Users page or the create a new user page.

Users:

Overview of all our users, from here you can go either back to the home page, or create a new user with the buttons beneath the title.
Below is a list of all existing users with two possible paths:

click "Show Details" to get to the User page and you will be shown more information for this specific user
click "Edit details of this user", to go to the EditUser page and either delete this user or to change their details.

Buttons at the top are purposely placed in this way, to avoid confusion if you are just entering this page and might want to confuse them with the buttons below.


User:

By clicking on "Show Details" you will get to a page where you can look at more information about a specific user, in this case their name, their hero name and address

click on "Return to Users List" to go back to the overview of all users.

New:

By clicking either the link for creating a new user on the home page or any of the "Create a new User" buttons you will see an interactive Form, where you can insert data for a new user

Insert at least one character for each of these text fields and click "Create new User", then another tab will be opened with a confirmation message

If at least one text field is blank, when clicking on the button "Create new User" a new tab will open and you will get displayed an error message

After creating a new user, just close the extra tab and create either a new user, or click on the button for "Return to Users List" or "Home" to check if the user was successfully created or to return to the home page

Edit:

By clicking "Edit details of this user" you will go to the Edit page, where you can see the current details of the user you selected and buttons for "Edit", "Delete" and "Return to Users List"

Edit details of the user

Write your changes for specific details of a user in the corresponding text field and click on "Edit" when finished. You will now see another Tab with a message of confirmation, if you successfully changed the user. Close this tab and click on the button "Return to Users List" to go back to the overview of all users, to see if the changes are being applied

If you want to submit at least one empty text field, you will be shown an error message in a seperate tab. 

Delete a user

By clicking "Delete" you will erase this user from the users list, and another tab with a message of confirmation will open, close this tab and click on "Return to Users List" to go back to the overview of all users and check if this user got removed

if you click "Delete" a second time, after already deleting a user, you will be displayed an error message in another tab, telling you that this user cannot be found, same goes for clicking "Edit" after you already deleted a certain user.



We chose to let the forms for creating a new user and editing/deleting of a user being left aligned, because in general you are more used to this style of interactive forms.
